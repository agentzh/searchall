SearchAll is a handy side-by-side search engine comparison tool which allows you to search at most 3 different search engines simultaneously and benchmark their performance in the status bar.

With this extension, you can compare 2 to 3 search engines at a time. There's a long list of default search engines that you can choose from (including search.cpan.org!).

In fact, SearchAll allows you to enter your own site's URL in those editable drop-down lists and there's a general-purpose data extracting algorithm in SearchAll for extracting items from unknown site's results pages. Unfortunately, the pattern mining algorithm is a bit slow on ordinary machines and it does not work for 100% of the sites over the web. Well, we're improving it :)

Currently only the sites' raw HTML pages and a simple "Formatted View" are shown to the user. We'll add more comprehensive and more intuitive views and graphics for the search results in the near future. Please stay tuned!

This project was initiated and has been sponsored by the Yahoo! China (http://cn.yahoo.com) company and opensourced under the MIT license.

One of our buzzwords (for extension developers) is that there's 0 line of XUL/RDF/XML in our project's source tree. The UI stuff is totally scripted in Perl. Thanks to Jesse Vincent's Template::Declare module on CPAN.

You can always get the latest source code of this project from the following SVN repository:

If you like to help, please let us know. We're very willing to deliver the commit bit like the Pugs team ;)
