* Fixed yisou.com so that SearchAll can work with it in 'page mode'.

* Now we use '<<Prev' and 'Next>>' labels instead of arrow icons in the navigation buttons.
* Set clickSelectsAll for the toolbar's textbox (just like the Google toolbar :)).

* Fixed a bug that baidu.com will show loading animation forever when there's no results at all.
* Hides 'please enter your queries above' as early as possilbe in 'page mode'.

* Cached the html so that next/prev page switching is now much more smoothly.
* Use WPL.STATE_IS_NETWORK instead of STATE_IS_WINDOW to eliminate bogus progressing actions.
* Improved and optimzied the pattern mining algorithm and implementation.
* Made the auto-form-submitting code much smarter.
